# 🩺 Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Detection Using Machine Learning

This project is a **CKD prediction system** that uses machine learning to identify the likelihood of **Chronic Kidney Disease** in patients based on medical attributes. It provides early warnings, hospital recommendations, dietary suggestions, and rich data visualizations — all through a user-friendly **Streamlit web app**.

---

## 🌟 Key Features

- 🔍 **CKD Prediction** using a trained machine learning model (Random Forest)
- 📊 **Visualize uploaded patient data** with graphs and heatmaps
- 🏥 **City-based hospital suggestions** with contact, maps, and websites
- 🥗 **Personalized dietary recommendations** for kidney health
- 🔐 **Login system** for secure access

---

## 🧠 How It Works

You input various patient attributes (like age, blood pressure, sugar, creatinine, etc.)  
👉 The app processes your inputs and predicts whether the person is likely to have CKD  
👉 If CKD is detected, it recommends:
- Diet changes
- Nearby nephrology hospitals
- Health advice for management

## 🧪 Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Scikit-learn** – ML model (Random Forest)
- **Streamlit** – for building the interactive web app
- **Pandas, NumPy** – for data handling
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly** – for visualizations
- **Folium, Google Maps** – for hospital locations
- **Joblib** – to load trained models
- **FuzzyWuzzy** – for flexible city name matching
